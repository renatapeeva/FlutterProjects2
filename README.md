## Random Joke App

This Flutter app fetches and displays random jokes using the "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/" API. The app features a main screen listing joke types as clickable cards, which lead to a screen displaying jokes of the selected type. Additionally, there is a "Random Joke of the Day" screen accessible via a button in the app bar. The project is organized into models, screens, widgets, and services, following a clean architecture.
